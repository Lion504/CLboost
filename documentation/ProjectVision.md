# CL Booster: Product Vision
## Problem Statement
The modern job market is hyper-competitive. Job seekers often apply to hundreds of positions, making a high-quality cover letter essential for standing out.

However, job seekers currently face a "lose-lose" dilemma:

- Manual Writing: High quality, but incredibly time-consuming.

- Generic AI (e.g., ChatGPT): Fast, but results are often low-quality, robotic, or fail to address specific job nuances.

- There is a clear need for a specialized tool that balances speed with bespoke quality.

## Target Audience
Global job seekers looking for a convenient way to generate professional, tailored cover letters that increase their interview conversion rates.

## Value Proposition
We offer users the two things they value most: Time and Quality.

Instead of settling for generic AI output or wasting hours on manual drafts, CL Booster provides a "Third Choice." Our app analyzes three critical data points to generate superior results:

- The user’s resume.

- The specific job advertisement.

- Relevant company information.

## Key Features & Functionality
Profile Management: Create, view, and update a comprehensive user profile.

- Resume Vault: Upload and manage different versions of resumes tailored to various industries or roles.

- AI Context Scanner: Use advanced AI to scan resumes and target job descriptions to extract key "selling points."

- Application History: A timestamped log of generated cover letters paired with their respective job positions.

- LinkedIn Integration: Sync the app profile directly with a user's LinkedIn profile for seamless data entry.

## Goals & Objectives
- Efficiency: Streamline the creation process to make it quick and easy for all users.

- Success Rate: Increase the user's chances of getting hired by 30%.

- Capacity: Increase the user’s job application volume by 15% or more through smart automation.
